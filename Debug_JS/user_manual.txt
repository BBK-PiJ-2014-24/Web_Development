USER MANUAL FOR DEBUGGER
-------------------------

THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD LAUNCH OBJECT WITH THE CORRECT EXECUTION FILE.

2. IN THE LAUNCH OBJECT ADD THIS PROPERTY SO IT CAN FIND THE NODE PATH:
"runtimeExecutable": "/home/stewart/.nvm/versions/node/v11.6.0/bin/node"

/home/stewart/.nvm/versions/node/v11.6.0/bin/node --inspect-brk=21700 Debug_JS/bin/www
